Port of Mupen64 for the Gamecube/Wii

Port of the popular multi-OS N64 emulator, Mupen64, to the Nintendo Gamecube and Wii through the libOGC library. The emulator currently uses dynamic recompilation of the N64 machine code to PowerPC (the Gamecube/Wii's ISA) and full hardware accelerated graphics to achieve (near) full-speed emulation in most instances.
